# nomad_job

Manages a job registered in Nomad.

This can be used to initialize your cluster with system jobs, common services,
and more. In day to day Nomad use it is common for developers to submit jobs to
Nomad directly, such as for general app deployment. In addition to these apps, a
Nomad cluster often runs core system services that are ideally setup during
infrastructure creation. This resource is ideal for the latter type of job, but
can be used to manage any job within Nomad.

~> **Warning:** this resource will store any sensitive values placed in
  `consul_token` or `vault_token` in the Terraform's state file. Take care to
  [protect your state file](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

Registering a job from a jobspec file:

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  jobspec = file("${path.module}/jobspec.hcl")
}
```

Registering a job from an inline jobspec. This is less realistic but
is an example of how it is possible. More likely, the contents will
be paired with something such as the
[template_file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/template/d/file.html)
resource to render parameterized jobspecs.

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  jobspec = <<EOT
job "foo" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  type        = "service"
  group "foo" {
    task "foo" {
      driver = "raw_exec"
      config {
        command = "/bin/sleep"
        args    = ["1"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 20
        memory = 10
      }

      logs {
        max_files     = 3
        max_file_size = 10
      }
    }
  }
}
EOT
}
```

## JSON jobspec

The input jobspec can also be provided as JSON instead of HCL by setting the
argument `json` to `true`:

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  jobspec = file("${path.module}/jobspec.json")
  json    = true
}
```

When using JSON, the input jobspec should have the same structured used by the
[Nomad API](https://www.nomadproject.io/api-docs/json-jobs/). The Nomad CLI
can translate HCL jobs to JSON:

```shellsession
nomad job run -output my-job.nomad > my-job.json
```

Or you can also use the [`/v1/jobs/parse`](https://www.nomadproject.io/api-docs/jobs/#parse-job)
API endpoint.

## HCL2 jobspec

By default, HCL jobs are parsed using the [HCL2 format](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/hcl2).
If your job is not compatible with HCL2 you may set the `hcl1` argument to
`true` to use the previous HCL1 parser.

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  jobspec = file("${path.module}/jobspec.hcl")

  hcl1 = true
}
```

-> **Note:** HCL1 parsing is only provided for backwards compatibility with
  older jobspecs and may not support newer job features and functionalities, so
  it should be avoided whenever possible.

### Variables

~> **Warning:** mixing Nomad HCL2 variables and Terraform values may result in
  plan failures. It's best to avoid using variables in job files and instead
  use [string templates][tf_docs_string_template] or render a file with the
  [`templatefile`][tf_docs_templatefile] Terraform function.

HCL2 variables can be passed from Terraform to the jobspec parser through the
`vars` attribute inside the `hcl2` block. The variable must also be declared
inside the jobspec as an [input variable](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/hcl2/variables#declaring-an-input-variable).

Due to the way resource attributes are stored in the Terraform state, the
values must be provided as strings.

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  hcl2 {
    vars = {
      "restart_attempts" = "5",
      "datacenters"      = "[\"dc1\", \"dc2\"]",
    }
  }

  jobspec = <<EOT
variable "datacenters" {
  type = list(string)
}

variable "restart_attempts" {
  type = number
}

job "foo-hcl2" {
  datacenters = var.datacenters

  restart {
    attempts = var.restart_attempts
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Variables must have known-values at plan time. This means that you will not be
able to reference values from resources that don't exist in the Terraform state
yet. Instead, use [string templates][tf_docs_string_template] or the
[`templatefile`][tf_docs_templatefile] Terraform function to provide a fully
rendered jobspec.

```hcl
resource "random_pet" "random_dc" {}

# This resource will fail to plan because random_pet.random_dc.id is unknown.
resource "nomad_job" "job_with_hcl2" {
  jobspec = <<EOT
variable "datacenter" {
  type = string
}

job "example" {
  datacenters = [var.datacenter]
  ...
}
EOT

  hcl2 {
    vars = {
      datacenter = random_pet.random_dc.id
    }
  }
}

# This will work since Terraform will provide a fully rendered jobspec once it
# knows the value of random_pet.random_dc.id.
resource "nomad_job" "job_with_hcl2" {
  jobspec = <<EOT
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["${random_pet.random_dc.id}"]
  ...
}
EOT
}
```

### Filesystem functions

Please note that [filesystem functions](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/hcl2/functions/file/abspath)
will create an implicit dependency in your Terraform configuration. For
example, Terraform will not be able to detect changes to files loaded using the
[`file`](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/hcl2/functions/file/file)
function inside a jobspec.


To avoid confusion, these functions are disabled by default. To enable them
set `allow_fs` to `true`:

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "app" {
  jobspec = file("${path.module}/jobspec.hcl")

  hcl2 {
    allow_fs = true
  }
}
```

If you do need to track changes to external files, you can use the
[`local_file`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs/data-sources/file)
data source and the [`templatefile`][tf_docs_templatefile] function to load the
local file into Terraform and then render its content into the jobspec:

```hcl
# main.tf

data "local_file" "index_html" {
  filename = "${path.module}/index.html"
}

resource "nomad_job" "nginx" {
  jobspec = templatefile("${path.module}/nginx.nomad.tpl", {
    index_html = data.local_file.index_html.content
  })
}
```

```hcl
# nginx.nomad.tpl

job "nginx" {
...
      template {
        data        = <<EOF
${index_html}
EOF
        destination = "local/www/index.html"
      }
...
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `jobspec` `(string: <required>)` - The contents of the jobspec to register.

- `deregister_on_destroy` `(boolean: true)` - Determines if the job will be
  deregistered when this resource is destroyed in Terraform.

- `purge_on_destroy` `(boolean: false)` - Set this to true if you want the job to
  be purged when the resource is destroyed.

- `deregister_on_id_change` `(boolean: true)` - Determines if the job will be
  deregistered if the ID of the job in the jobspec changes.

- `rerun_if_dead` `(boolean: false)` - Set this to true to force the job to run
  again if its status is `dead`.

- `detach` `(boolean: true)` - If true, the provider will return immediately
  after creating or updating, instead of monitoring.

- `policy_override` `(boolean: false)` - Determines if the job will override any
  soft-mandatory Sentinel policies and register even if they fail.

- `json` `(boolean: false)` - Set this to `true` if your jobspec is structured with
  JSON instead of the default HCL.

- `hcl1` `(boolean: false)` - Set this to `true` to use the previous HCL1
  parser. This option is provided for backwards compatibility only and should
  not be used unless absolutely necessary.

- `hcl2` `(block: optional)` - Options for the HCL2 jobspec parser.
  - `enabled` `(boolean: false)` - **Deprecated** All HCL jobs are parsed as
    HCL2 by default.
  - `allow_fs` `(boolean: false)` - Set this to `true` to be able to use
    [HCL2 filesystem functions](#filesystem-functions)

- `consul_token` `(string: <optional>)` - Consul token used when registering this job.
  Will fallback to the value declared in Nomad provider configuration, if any.

- `vault_token` `(string: <optional>)` - Vault token used when registering this job.
  Will fallback to the value declared in Nomad provider configuration, if any.

### Timeouts

`nomad_job` provides the following [`Timeouts`][tf_docs_timeouts] configuration
options when [`detach`](#detach) is set to `false`:

- `create` `(string: "5m")` - Timeout when registering a new job.
- `update` `(string: "5m")` - Timeout when updating an existing job.

## Importing Jobs

Jobs are imported using the pattern `<job ID>@<namespace>`.

```console
$ terraform import nomad_job.example example@my-namespace
nomad_job.example: Importing from ID "example@my-namespace"...
nomad_job.example: Import prepared!
  Prepared nomad_job for import
nomad_job.example: Refreshing state... [id=example@my-namespace]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
